- 🧪 Test coverage with [Coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy).
- 🗄️ Optionally deploy a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) SQL database [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and the [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) Web interface to manage it.

## ✨ Usage

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) Engine

### Generate a new project

To generate a new project directory inside the specified dir:

```bash
./generate-project.sh dir/where/project/dir/will/be/created
```

This will launch the cookiecutter project creation assistant in a Docker container. Follow its instructions to setup the project.

## 🤓 Template parameters

- `project_description`
- `author_name`
- `author_email`
- `project_url`
- `python_version`
- `with_postgresql` [false, true]: whether or not to run a PostgreSQL database Docker container alongside the dev container. The PostgreSQL data will be stored in a Docker volume. The following parameters are only relevant when `with_postgresql` is `true`:
